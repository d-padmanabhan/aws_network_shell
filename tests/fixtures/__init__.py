"""Realistic AWS mock data fixtures for comprehensive testing.

This module provides production-quality mock data that mirrors real AWS API responses.
Each fixture includes realistic IDs, names, configurations, and relationships between resources.

Architecture:
- Multi-region setup (eu-west-1, us-east-1, ap-southeast-2)
- Production/Staging/Development environments
- Interconnected VPCs via Transit Gateway and CloudWAN
- Network Firewalls for inspection
- Load balancers with target groups and health checks
