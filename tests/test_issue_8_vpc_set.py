"""Test for issue #8: Error trying to set VPC with VPC ID.

Issue: When using 'set vpc vpc-019dd8e2dee602c9c' (VPC ID directly),
the shell throws: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'

Root cause: VPCs without a Name tag have name=None in the dict.
The _resolve method used item.get("name", "").lower() which returns None
when the key exists but has value None, causing .lower() to fail.

Fix: Changed to (item.get("name") or "").lower() to handle None values.
